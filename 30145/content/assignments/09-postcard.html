<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>The final image will be a composite of image that evoke the style of a vintage postcard. You may chose either a real or imaginary location. To do this project, you will need to collect multiple iconic images of the area. You will need to use your previous knowledge of layers and clipping masks to make the full composition.</p>

<p>Your intention is not necessarily to create a simple collage of images, but rather to create a composition that evokes a sense of place. To that end, be aware of things like layout, composition, focal point, color, texture, and typography.</p>
