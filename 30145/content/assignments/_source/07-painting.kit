<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Given the name, Photoshop has traditionally focused on manipulating and refining photos. The tools exist, however, to also take those photos from realistic imagery to more &ldquo;painterly&rdquo; presentations.</p>

<p>As a professional digital artist, you want to respect both the original images and the pixels used in the digital file. Photoshop brushes have realistic textures and bristles. They resemble their real world counterparts allowing you to create an effect like that of a real drawing or painting. Begin this project by finding any image that you would like to add a painterly affect to, and use that image as a guide.</p>

<h3>Project Specifications</h3>
<p>To satisfy the project requirements you will need to submit one finished high-resolution Photoshop image at least 1500 pixels by 2000 pixels. You will also need to submit your original un-retouched images along with your final image so that I can see where you started. You can include the original images as separate layers in the final image file.</p>
<p>Save your image with appropriate names, following the file naming convention:</p>
<pre><code>
  yourname-painting.psd
</code>
</pre>

<p class="alert alert-success">Once completed, upload your images to the <a href="<!-- @painting-dropbox -->" target="_top" class="alert-link">Painting Dropbox</a>.</p>
