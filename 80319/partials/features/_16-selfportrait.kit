<h2 class="feature-heading"><span class="text-muted"> Week Sixteen: </span><br />  Self Portrait </h2>

<p class="lead">
	During these final weeks of class, you will work on a self portrait. But instead of it being just a simple picture of yourself, you will need to use all of the different skills that you've learned throughout the semester, and create a movie poster starring yourself.
</p>

<p>
	So first, think about what kind of movie you would like to star in. Or think about what kind of movie does your life currently remind you of. Take these ideas and design your self portrait movie poster.
