<h2 class="feature-heading"><span class="text-muted"> Break Week: </span><br />  Happy Spring Break </h2>

<p class="lead">
	After eight weeks of assignments and projects, its time to take a breather for a week. So take this time to not work on anything. The author William Feather said, <em>"One way to get the most out of life is to look upon it as an adventure."</em> So go have an adventure this week.
