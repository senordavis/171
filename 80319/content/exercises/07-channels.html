<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>
<p>For this exercise you will be using channels to make selections on two different Photographs.</p>
<p>The first image, <strong><a href="https://d2l.lcc.edu/d2l/le/content/138413/viewContent/3340106/View">lotus.jpg</a></strong>, you will use channels to create a saved selection (Alpha Channels) of the flower. Use this selection to create a Layer Mask around the flyer and then <strong>place it on a different background</strong>.</p>
<p>For the second image, I've added a few versions of the photo so that you may choose one of them to create a selection using channels. Create a Layer mask around the woman in the photograph and <strong>place her on a different background</strong>.</p>
