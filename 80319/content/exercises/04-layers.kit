<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>
<p>In this assignment, you will composite multiple images to create a new image. This picture should feature an image of yourself placed into an unlikely, unique or impossible location.</p>
<p>There should be at least five objects on five layers, including the picture of yourself, and you should try to make it look as &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; as possible, given the imaginary nature of the picture.</p>
<p>You might place yourself at the North Pole, for example, climbing the Eiffel Tower, jumping over the moon &hellip; or simply standing beside the President at his Inaugural.</p>
<p>At least one layer should contain some text with something like your name, or the location that you are at in your composite image.</p>
<p>Use blend modes and layer effects to enhance the believability of your image.</p>
<p>Save your image scans with appropriate names, following the file naming convention:</p>
<pre><code>
  yourname-layers.psd
