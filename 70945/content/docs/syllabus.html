In order to ensure this vision, the College has established the LCC Student Code of Conduct and the Student General Rules and Guidelines to ensure the protection of student rights and the health and safety of the College community, as well as to support the efficient operation of College programs. In addition, the College has established guidelines for the redress of grievances by individuals accused in such proceedings. A copy of the most current Code can be found on the College’s website at <a href="http://lcc.edu/catalog/policies_procedures/studentrulesguidelines.aspx#code" target="_blank">lcc.edu/catalog/policies_procedures/studentrulesguidelines.aspx#code</a>.

			<h1>Additional Items</h1>
				<section class="netiquette">
	<h2>Netiquette</h2>

<p>
	Netiquette (or network etiquette) is commonly defined as a set of principles developed to express courtesy and help people communicate appropriately while sending e-mail and using the Internet. The Instructor and course participants alike will demonstrate etiquette and civility whenever interacting with each other. Please use standard “Business English” (complete sentences) and avoid jargon or slang when communicating.
</p>

<p>
	Consider anything said in public forums (Web-based applications explored in this course, our discussion forums, and when giving feedback to other participants) to be public information. Do not post/make comments that may be considered controversial, abrasive, in poor taste, or may reveal too much personal information - protect your privacy.
</p></section>

<section class="academic-honesty">
	<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>
	Academic integrity is essential to a positive teaching and learning environment. All students enrolled in College courses are expected to complete coursework responsibilities with fairness and honesty. Failure to do so by seeking unfair advantage over others or misrepresenting someone else’s work as your own can result in disciplinary action, as outlined in the College Academic Dishonesty Policy.
</p></section>

<section class="plagiarism">
	<h2>Plagiarism Policy</h2>
<p>
	Plagiarism is a cardinal subject in art. Fair use will be covered in some detail throughout the class. Failing to understand fair use — intentionally or not — can cost a creative company or individual millions of dollars. This is why LCC’s goal is to correct plagiarism and unfair use early on.
</p>

<p>
	Plagiarized assignments will be scored as zero with no chance to make up the assignment—whether the cause was malice or ignorance. You will lose all participation points for the day. In certain cases, particularly multiple offenses, it may be reported to the LCC Behavior Intervention Team.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>If ever in doubt, draw it or shoot it yourself.</strong>

<section class="acceptable-use">
	<h2>Computer Resources – Acceptable Use</h2>

<p>
	Use of College-owned computer resources is a privilege extended by the College to students, employees, and other authorized users as a tool to promote the mission of the College.

<section class="labs">
	<h2>Computer Graphics Labs Policies</h2>

<section class="alert alert-warning" style="padding: 30px;">
	<p>
		<strong>Check in at GB 113</strong>, and give your validated LCC ID to the lab aide. At some times the staff may be in one of the labs solving a problem. Ring the bell, or seek the staff in one of the other rooms, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, or <b>116</b>. The staff will keep your ID until you check out.
	</p>
	
	<br />
	
	<p>
		The lab aide will check to see if you are on the list. You must sign a rules sheet upon entering the lab for the first time each semester.
	</p>
	
	<br />
	
	<p>
		The lab aide will assign you a seat and give you a card with the number of the station on it. That card is your proof you are in the lab legitimately. Stick it to the velcro square at the upper left corner of your monitor, where all can see it.
	</p>
</section>

<p class="alert alert-info">
	To check out a manual, or other resource material, fill out a check out slip.  These materials may not leave the lab at any time.
</p>

<p>
	<strong style="color: red;">THE LAB AIDES ARE NOT YOUR PERSONAL TUTORS</strong>. They may answer general questions, but they are there to look after the lab, not the users.
</p>

<h3>When the lab is crowded:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>No one will be forced to give up a computer who has not used it for at least an hour.</li>
	<li>The user who signed in earliest will be the first asked to leave.</li>
	<li>Anyone who leaves a computer for more than ten minutes may be considered finished, and the station may be assigned to the next user.</li>
</ul>

<p class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Lab aides are the final arbiter of how lab time will be distributed fairly.</strong></p>

<h3>Use of Printers</h3>

<p>
	Use of printers is limited to ONLY classwork for Art, Design and Multimedia classes which meet in the lab! Special projects may be okayed by your instructor, or the CG program coordinator. You MUST print a proof to a black and white printer and check it carefully before printing to a color printer. Color printers are for final copy ONLY--one color print per project, ever. If there is a problem, you must get permission to print again from your instructor or from the Lab Technicians.
</p>

<p>
	Users may not use papers brought in from outside the lab, except in special cases approved by the Lab Technician. If you discover a problem with any hardware or software, please report it to the lab aide or your instructor <b>AT ONCE</b>.
