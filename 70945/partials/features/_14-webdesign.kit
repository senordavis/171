	          There will be times that you need to design a website. And for many people it will involve writing lines of code. But how do you know what the site should look like?

          <p class="lead">
	          Using Photoshop you can design a page/site that you can show to your clients or coworkers so that everyone understands what the site should look like.
          </p>
          
          <p>
	          Even if you are working on your own site, I recommend building a design to have an idea of what you would like your site to look like.
