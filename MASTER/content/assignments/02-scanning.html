<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>After successful completion of this assignment, the student will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate correct scanning resolutions for different image applications.</li>
<li>Execute a series of image scans that demonstrate an appropriate tonal range.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>
<p>Using your own photographic images (prints, magazines, etc.) complete the following image scans using a flatbed scanner. Save your image scans with appropriate names, following the file naming convention:</p>
<pre><code>
  yourname-scan-color.psd

  yourname-scan-gray.psd

  yourname-scan-color-web.psd
</code>
</pre>
<p class="alert alert-success">Once scanned and named, upload your images to the <a href="https://d2l.lcc.edu/d2l/le/content/86643/viewContent/3836365/View" target="_self" class="alert-link">Scanning Assignment Dropbox</a>.</p>
