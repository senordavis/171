<h2>Doh!</h2>
<p>
	Hey everyone, some of your fellow classmates informed me today that the <a href="https://d2l.lcc.edu/d2l/le/content/149631/viewContent/3616291/View">syllabus</a> has some incorrect and missing information.   
</p>

<p>
	As it turns out, the import function of D2L worked exactly as it was supposed to. I made the mistake of importing the incorrect previous course files though.
</p>

<p>
	My apologies if this caused you any frustration. The <a href="https://d2l.lcc.edu/d2l/le/content/149631/viewContent/3616291/View">syllabus</a> has now been updated with the correct information.
</p>

<p>
	Please remember that you have as many chances as you need to take the <a href="https://d2l.lcc.edu/d2l/le/content/149631/viewContent/3616292/View">syllabus quiz</a>. So if you have already done it, I am sorry for the incorrect information. It is correct now and you should be able to retake the quiz with the correct information.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>If you encounter any other problems, please email me and let me know.</strong>
