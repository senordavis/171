<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This project will focus on creating a web page for an animal, real or imaginary, of your chosing..</p>
<p>The interface should consider what the primary content about the animal you have chosen is. In what order do they read the information? How should a user feel when they visit the page, and what should be their lasting experience? Decide how the color scheme, typography and layout help to reinforce the message. A good place to start is by looking at the other websites, or just other sites in general.</p>
