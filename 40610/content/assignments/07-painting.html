<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>
Given the name, Photoshop has traditionally focused on manipulating and refining photos. The tools exist, however, to also take those photos from realistic imagery to more painterly presentations.
</p>

<p>
As a professional digital artist, you want to respect both the original images and the pixels used in the digital file.
</p>

<p>
Photoshop brushes have realistic textures and bristles. They resemble their real-world counterparts allowing you to create an effect like that of a real drawing or painting.
</p>

<p>
Begin this project by finding an image that you would like to add a painterly effect to, and use that image as a guide.
</p>

<h3>Project Specifications</h3>
<p>
  To satisfy the project requirements, you must submit one finished high-resolution image at least 1500 pixels by 2000 pixels.
</p>

<p>
  You will also need to submit your original un-retouched image. You can include the original image as a separate layer in the final PSD.
</p>

<p>Save your image with the appropriate name, following the file naming convention:</p>
<pre><code>
  yourname-painting.psd
</code>
