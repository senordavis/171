<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Digital imaging has changed how old or damaged prints are retouched and restored.</p>

<p>
  Developing the skills to restore old or damaged images could be your ticket to a job in digital imaging.
</p>

<p>
  Each student will complete the entire production process of retouching and image to produce a final restored image.
</p>

<p>
  Remember that as a digital artist, you want to respect both the original image and the pixels used in the digital file.
</p>

<p>
  Your purpose is not to overly clean the image so that it looks as if it were new. It is to restore and reveal the quality and character of the original photo.
</p>


<p>
  Make sure that you go beyond just cleaning up dust spots. Use the digital tools that Photoshop offers to set yourself up for optimal control and flexibility while restoring the photo.
