<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>
	For this project you will work on a portrait of yourself. But instead of it being just a simple picture of yourself, you will use all of the different skills that you have learned throughout the semester to create a movie poster starring yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The final image for this project will be a composite image that, just like a movie poster, tells a story about you and the crazy world that you live in. Source imagery and content is completely up to you, but the final image needs to be more than a photo of you with some filters applied.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that you want to respect both the original images and the pixels used in the digital file. Your intention is not necessarily to create a simple collage of elements, but rather to create an artistic statement. Remember to take into consideration things like composition, focal point, color, texture, technique, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Use the digital tools that Photoshop offers to add the different effects needed using the techniques we have already learned to give yourself the most flexibility when building your design.
