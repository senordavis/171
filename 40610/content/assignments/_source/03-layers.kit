<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>
<p>In this assignment, you will composite multiple images to create a new image. This picture should feature an image of yourself placed in an unlikely, unique, or impossible location. </p>

<p>There should be at least five objects on five layers, including the picture of yourself.</p>

<p>Your goal is to make the composite look as realistic as possible, given the imaginary nature of the picture.</p>

<p>You might place yourself at the North Pole, climbing the Eiffel Tower, jumping over the moon, or standing beside the President at his Inaugural.</p>

<p>At least one layer should contain some text with something like your name or the location that you are at in your composite image.</p>

<p>Use blend modes and layer effects to enhance the believability of your image.</p>

<p>Save your file with the appropriate name, following the file naming convention:</p>

<pre><code>
  yourname-layers.psd
</code>
