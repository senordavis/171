						Netiquette (or network etiquette) is commonly defined as a set of principles developed to express courtesy and help people communicate appropriately while sending e-mail and using the Internet. The Instructor and course participants alike will demonstrate etiquette and civility whenever interacting with each other. Please use standard “Business English” (complete sentences) and avoid jargon or slang when communicating.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Consider anything said in public forums (Web-based applications explored in this course, our discussion forums, and when giving feedback to other participants) to be public information. Do not post/make comments that may be considered controversial, abrasive, in poor taste, or may reveal too much personal information - protect your privacy.

					<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
					
					<p>
						Academic integrity is essential to a positive teaching and learning environment. All students enrolled in College courses are expected to complete coursework responsibilities with fairness and honesty.

							<strong>Check in at GB 1303</strong>, and give your validated LCC ID to the lab aide. At some times the staff may be in one of the labs solving a problem. Ring the bell, or seek the staff in one of the other rooms, <b>1308</b>, <b>1304</b>, <b>1302</b>, <b>1272</b>, or <b>1268</b>. The staff will keep your ID until you check out.
						</p>
						
						<br />
						
						<p>
							The lab aide will check to see if you are on the list. You must sign a rules sheet upon entering the lab for the first time each semester.
						</p>
						
						<br />
						
						<p>
							The lab aide will assign you a seat and give you a card with the number of the station on it. That card is your proof you are in the lab legitimately. Stick it to the velcro square at the upper left corner of your monitor, where all can see it.
						</p>

						To check out a manual, or other resource material, fill out a check out slip.  These materials may not leave the lab at any time.

						<li>Anyone who leaves a computer for more than ten minutes may be considered finished, and the station may be assigned to the next user.</li>

					<h3>Use of Printers</h3>
					
					<p>
						Use of printers is limited to ONLY classwork for Art, Design and Multimedia classes which meet in the lab! Special projects may be okayed by your instructor, or the CG program coordinator. You MUST print a proof to a black and white printer and check it carefully before printing to a color printer. Color printers are for final copy ONLY--one color print per project, ever. If there is a problem, you must get permission to print again from your instructor or from the Lab Technicians.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Users may not use papers brought in from outside the lab, except in special cases approved by the Lab Technician. If you discover a problem with any hardware or software, please report it to the lab aide or your instructor <b>AT ONCE</b>.
