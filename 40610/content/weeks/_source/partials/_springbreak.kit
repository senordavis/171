<h2 class="feature-heading"><span class="text-muted"> Break Week: </span><br /> Happy Spring Break </h2>

<p class="lead">
	After eight weeks of assignments and projects, its time to take a breather.<br /> If you have assignments that you need to catch up on take this time to work on them. If you are all caught up, take this time to rest and recoup. We will jump back into our work next week with a few more assignments and then your final project.
