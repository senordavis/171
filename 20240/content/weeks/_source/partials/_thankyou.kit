	Thank you all! It has been a great semester. I hope that you were able to learn something about using Photoshop to make graphics. I acknowledge that occasionally Photoshop can be a difficult software application to use. But hopefully, through this class, you were able to gain confidence in using it to create different designs and graphics.

	<strong>Good Luck in all that you do, and have a great break. </strong>
