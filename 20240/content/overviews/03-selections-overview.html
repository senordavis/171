<p>This overview is very long and covers a lot of information. If you are having trouble reading it online, print it out on paper or <a href="http://mdavis.in/171/overviews/selections-overview.pdf" class="text-warning" target="_blank">view this PDF</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">When you create a selection, Photoshop will show you an animated dotted line around the object that you've selected. This line is endearingly referred to as "marching ants".</p>
<p class="lead">You can select part of a layer&rsquo;s contents or everything on a single layer. Whenever you have an active selection Photoshop will only manipulate that portion of the document. Any tool you use (except the Type, Pen, and Shape tools) will affect only the area inside the selection.</p>
<p class="lead">Lets take a look at some of the most common commands you will use when making selections.</p>
<dl><dt>Select All</dt><dd>
<p>This command selects the whole document and places marching ants around the perimeter, which is helpful when you want to copy and paste an entire image into another program or create a border around a photo. To run this command, go to <strong>Select &rarr; All</strong> or press <strong>⌘-A</strong> (Ctrl+A on a PC).</p>
</dd><dt>Deselect</dt><dd>
<p>To get rid of the marching ants after you&rsquo;ve finished working with a selection, choose <strong>Select &rarr; Deselect</strong> or press <strong>⌘-D</strong> (Ctrl+D). Alternatively, if you&rsquo;ve got one of the selection tools activated in the Tools panel, you can click once outside the selection to get rid of it.</p>
</dd><dt>Reselect</dt><dd>
<p>To resurrect your last selection, choose <strong>Select &rarr; Reselect</strong> or press <strong>Shift-⌘-D</strong> (Shift-Ctrl-D). This command reactivates the last selection you made, even if it was five filters and 20 brushstrokes ago (unless you&rsquo;ve used the Crop or Type tools since then, which render the Reselect command powerless).</p>
</dd><dt>Inverse</dt><dd>
<p>This command, which you run by going to <strong>Select &rarr; Inverse</strong> or pressing <strong>Shift-⌘-I</strong> (Shift-Ctrl-I), flip-flops a selection to select everything that wasn&rsquo;t selected before. You&rsquo;ll often find it easier to select what you don&rsquo;t want and then inverse the selection to get what you do want.</p>
</dd><dt>Load a layer as a selection.</dt><dd>
<p>This is activating a layer that contains the object you want to work with and then summoning the marching ants so they run around that object; that way, whatever you do next affects only that object. To load everything that lives on a single editable layer as a selection, mouse over to the Layers panel and <strong>⌘-click</strong> (Ctrl-click) the layer&rsquo;s thumbnail. Photoshop responds by putting marching ants around everything on that layer. Alternatively, you can <strong>Control-click</strong> (right-click on a PC) the layer&rsquo;s thumbnail and then choose Select Pixels from the resulting shortcut menu.</p>
</dd></dl><hr />
<p></p>
<h2>The Rectangular and Elliptical Marquee Tools</h2>
<p>Photoshop&rsquo;s most basic selection tools are the Rectangular and Elliptical Marquees. Anytime you need to make a selection that&rsquo;s squarish or roundish, reach for these little helpers, which live at the top of the Tools panel.</p>
<div class="row">
<p class="col-sm-6">To make a selection with either marquee tool, just grab the tool by clicking its icon in the Tools panel or by pressing <strong>M</strong>, and then mouse over to your document. When your cursor turns into a tiny + sign, drag across the area you want to select (you&rsquo;ll see the marching ants appear as soon as you start to drag). Photoshop starts the selection where you clicked and continues it in the direction you drag as long as you hold down the mouse button. When you&rsquo;ve got marching ants around the area you want to select, release the mouse button.</p>
<p class="col-sm-6"><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/davisgom/171/assets/images/selections/marquee-tool.png" class="img-responsive thumbnail" alt="screenshot of marquee tool and flyout menu in photoshop" /></p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-push-6">
<p>You can use a variety of tools and techniques to modify your selection, most of which are controlled by the Options bar across the top of the Photoshop interface. For example, you can do the following:</p>
<dl><dt>Move the selection</dt><dd>
<p>Click anywhere within the selected area and then drag to another part of your document (your cursor turns into a tiny arrow the second you release the mouse button after drawing a selection&mdash;as long as your cursor remains inside the selection, that is).</p>
</dd></dl></div>
<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-pull-6">
<p><span class="thumbnail"> <img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/davisgom/171/assets/images/selections/selection-modes.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="screenshot of marquee tool and flyout menu in photoshop" /> <a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/davisgom/171/assets/images/selections/selection-modes-big.jpg" target="_blank">View image larger in new window</a> </span></p>
</div>
</div>
<dl><dt style="color: #f15a24;">Add to the selection</dt><dd>
<p>When you click the "Add to selection" button in the Options bar press and hold the Shift key, Photoshop puts a tiny + sign beneath your cursor to let you know that whatever you drag across next will get added to the current selection. This mode is handy when you need to select areas that don&rsquo;t touch each other, like the doors below, or if you&rsquo;ve selected most of what you want but notice that you missed a spot. Instead of starting over, you can switch to this mode and draw around that area as if you were creating a new selection.</p>
</dd><dt style="color: #0071bc;">Subtract from the selection</dt><dd>
<p>Clicking the "Subtract from selection" button or pressing and holding the Option key (Alt on a PC) has the opposite effect. A tiny &ndash; sign appears beneath your cursor to let you know you&rsquo;re in this mode. Mouse over to your document and draw a box (or oval) around the area you want to deselect.</p>
</dd><dt style="color: #662d91;">Subtract from the selection</dt><dd>
<p>If you click the "Intersect with selection" button after you draw a selection, Photoshop lets you draw another selection that overlaps the first; the marching ants then surround only the area where the two selections overlap. It&rsquo;s a little confusing, but don&rsquo;t worry because you&rsquo;ll rarely use this mode. The keyboard shortcut is Shift+Option (Shift+Alt on a PC). Photoshop puts a tiny multiplication sign (x) beneath your cursor when you&rsquo;re in this mode.</p>
</dd><dt>Feather the selection</dt><dd>
<p>If you want to soften the edges of your selection so that it blends into the background or another image, use feathering. You can enter a value in pixels in this field before you create the selection, as it applies to the next selection you make. Feathering a selection lets you gently fade one image into another. By far the best method is to use the Properties panel&rsquo;s Feather slider, which lets you see how the feathered edge will look as well as change it later on. To use this method, create a selection and then add a layer mask. Next, open the Properties panel by choosing Window&rarr;Properties and, with the mask active in the Layers panel, drag the Feather slider to the right. Photoshop shows you the feathering in your document in real time. If you decide to change the amount of feathering later on, just activate the mask, pop this panel back open, and then tweak the same slider.</p>
</dd><dt>Apply anti-aliasing</dt><dd>
<p>Turn on the Anti-alias checkbox to make Photoshop smooth the color transition between the pixels around the edges of your selection and the pixels in the background. Like feathering, anti-aliasing softens the selection&rsquo;s edges slightly so that they blend better, though with anti-aliasing you can&rsquo;t control the amount of softening Photoshop applies. It&rsquo;s a good idea to leave this checkbox turned on unless you want your selection to have super crisp&mdash;and possibly jagged and blocky&mdash;edges.</p>
</dd><dt>Constrain the selection</dt><dd>
<p>If you want to constrain your selection to a fixed size or aspect ratio (so that the relationship between its width and height stays the same), you can select Fixed Size or Fixed Ratio from the Style pop-up menu and then enter the size you want in the resulting width and height fields. (Be sure to enter a unit of measurement into each field, such as px for pixels.) If you leave the Normal option selected, you can draw any size selection you want.</p>
</dd></dl><hr />
<p></p>
<h2>The Single Row and Column Marquee Tools</h2>
<p>The Marquee toolset also contains the Single Row Marquee and Single Column Marquee tools, which can select exactly one row or one column&rsquo;s worth of pixels, spanning either the width or the height of your document. You don&rsquo;t need to drag with your mouse to create a selection with these tools; just click once in your document and the marching ants appear.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<h2>Selecting by Color</h2>
<p>In addition to tools for selecting areas by shape, Photoshop has tools that let you select areas by color. This option is helpful when you want to select a chunk of an image that&rsquo;s fairly uniform in color, like someone&rsquo;s skin, the sky, or the paint job on a car.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<h2>The Quick Selection Tool</h2>
<p>The Quick Selection tool is easy to use and lets you create complex selections with just a few brushstrokes. As you paint with this tool, your selection expands outward to encompass pixels similar in color to the ones you&rsquo;re brushing across. It works insanely well if there&rsquo;s a fair amount of contrast between what you want to select and everything else. This tool lives in the same toolset as the Magic Wand.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
<p>To use this tool, click anywhere in the area you want to select or drag the brush cursor across it. When you do that, Photoshop thinks for a second and then creates a selection based on the color of the pixels you clicked or brushed across. The size of the area Photoshop selects is proportional to the size of the brush you&rsquo;re using: A larger brush creates a larger selection. You adjust the Quick Selection tool&rsquo;s brush size just like any other brush: by choosing a new size from the Brush picker in the Options bar, or by using the left and right bracket keys ([ and ]) to decrease and increase brush size (respectively). For the best results, use a hard-edged brush to produce well-defined edges (instead of the slightly transparent edges produced by a soft-edged brush) and turn on the Auto-Enhance setting.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6">
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/davisgom/171/assets/images/selections/quickselect-pepers.jpg" class="img-responsive thumbnail" alt="Peppers being selected using the quick select tool" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<dl><dt>New selection</dt><dd>
<p>When you first grab the Quick Selection tool, it&rsquo;s set to this mode, which creates a brand-new selection when you click or drag.</p>
</dd><dt>Add to selection</dt><dd>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve clicked or made an initial brushstroke, the Quick Selection tool automatically switches to this mode. Now Photoshop adds any areas you brush over or click to the current selection. If you don&rsquo;t like the selection Photoshop has created and want to start over, press &amp;#8984;-Z (Ctrl+Z on a PC) to undo it, or click the Options bar&rsquo;s "New selection" button and then brush across the area again. (The old selection disappears as soon as you start a new one.) To get rid of the marching ants altogether, choose Select&rarr;Deselect.</p>
</dd><dt>Subtract from selection</dt><dd>
<p>If Photoshop selected more than you wanted it to, click the &ldquo;Subtract from selection&rdquo; button (a tiny &ndash; sign appears in your cursor) and then simply paint across the area you don&rsquo;t want selected to make Photoshop exclude it. You can also press and hold the Option key (Alt on a PC) to enter &ldquo;Subtract from selection&rdquo; mode.</p>
</dd><dt>Brush Size/Hardness</dt><dd>
<p>Use a larger brush to select big areas and a smaller brush to select small or hard-to-reach areas. As explained earlier, you&rsquo;ll get better results with this tool by using a hard-edged brush instead of a soft-edged one.</p>
</dd><dt>Sample All Layers</dt><dd>
<p>This setting is initially turned off, which means Photoshop examines only the pixels on the active layer (the one that&rsquo;s highlighted in the Layers panel). If you turn on this setting, Photoshop examines everything in your document and grabs all similar pixels no matter which layer they&rsquo;re on.</p>
</dd><dt>Auto-Enhance</dt><dd>
<p>Because the Quick Selection tool makes selections extremely quickly, their edges can end up looking blocky and imperfect. Turn on this checkbox to tell Photoshop to take its time and think more carefully about the selections it makes. This feature gives your selections smoother edges, but if you&rsquo;re working with a really big file, it will take a long time.</p>
</dd></dl><hr />
<p></p>
<h2>The Magic Wand Tool</h2>
<p>The Magic Wand lets you select areas of color by clicking rather than dragging. It&rsquo;s in the same toolset as the Quick Selection tool, and you can grab it by pressing Shift-W (it looks like a wizard&rsquo;s wand). The Magic Wand is great for selecting solidcolored backgrounds or large bodies of similar color, like a cloudless sky, with just a couple of clicks. (The Quick Selection tool is better at selecting objects.)</p>
<p>When you click once with the Magic Wand in the area you want to select, Photoshop magically selects all the pixels on the currently active layer that are both similar in color and touching one another (see page 155 to learn how to tweak this behavior). If the color in the area you want to select varies a bit, Photoshop may not select all of it. In that case, you can add to the selection either by pressing and holding the Shift key as you click nearby areas or by modifying the Magic Wand&rsquo;s tolerance in the Options bar. To subtract from the selection, just press and hold the Option key (Alt on a PC) while you click the area you don&rsquo;t want included.</p>
<p>When you activate the Magic Wand, the Options bar includes these settings:</p>
<dl><dt>Sample Size</dt><dd>
<p>In CS6, this menu lets you change the way the Magic Wand calculates which pixels to select (in previous versions, you had to switch to the Eyedropper tool to see this menu). From the factory, it&rsquo;s set to Point Sample, which makes the tool look only at the color of the specific pixel you clicked when determining its selection. However, the menu&rsquo;s other options cause it to look at the original pixel and average it with the colors of surrounding pixels. For example, you can make the Magic Wand average the pixel you clicked plus the eight surrounding pixels by choosing &ldquo;3 by 3 Average,&rdquo; or as much as the surrounding 10,200 pixels by choosing &ldquo;101 by 101 Average.&rdquo; The &ldquo;3 by 3 Average&rdquo; setting works well for most images. If you need to select a really big area, you can experiment with one of the higher settings, like &ldquo;31 by 31 Average.&rdquo;</p>
</dd><dt>Tolerance</dt><dd>
<p>This setting controls both the Magic Wand&rsquo;s and the Quick Selection tool&rsquo;s sensitivity&mdash;how picky each tool is about which pixels it considers similar in color. If you increase this setting, the tool gets less picky (in other words, more tolerant) and selects every pixel that could possibly be described as similar to the one you clicked. If you decrease this setting, the tool gets pickier and selects only pixels that closely match the one you clicked.</p>
<p>Out of the box, the tolerance is set to 32, but it can go all the way up to 255. (If you set it to 0, Photoshop selects only pixels that exactly match the one you clicked; if you set it to 255, the program selects every color in the image.) It&rsquo;s usually a good idea to keep the tolerance fairly low (somewhere between 12 and 32); you can always click an area to see what kind of selection you get, increase the tolerance if you need to, and then click that area again (or add to the selection using the Shift key, as described above).</p>
</dd><dt>Anti-alias</dt><dd>
<p>Leave this setting turned on to make Photoshop soften the edges of the selection ever so slightly. If you want a super-crisp edge, turn it off.</p>
</dd><dt>Contiguous</dt><dd>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably want to leave this checkbox turned on; it makes the Magic Wand select pixels that are adjacent to one another. If you turn it off, Photoshop goes hog wild and selects all similar-colored pixels no matter where they are.</p>
</dd><dt>Sample all layers</dt><dd>
<p>If your document has multiple layers and you leave this check- box turned off, Photoshop examines only pixels on the active layer and ignores the other layers. If you turn this setting on, Photoshop examines the whole image and selects all pixels that are similar in color, no matter which layer they&rsquo;re on.</p>
</dd></dl>
<h3>Expanding Your Selection</h3>
<p>Sometimes the Magic Wand makes a nearly perfect selection, leaving you with precious few pixels to add to it. If this happens, it simply means that the elusive pixels are just a little bit lighter or darker in color than what the Magic Wand&rsquo;s tolerance setting allows for. You could Shift-click the elusive areas to add them to your selection, but the Select menu has a couple of options that can quickly expand the selection for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Select&rarr;Grow to make Photoshop expand the selection to all similar- colored pixels adjacent to it.</li>
<li>Choose Select&rarr;Similar to make Photoshop select similar-colored pixels throughout the whole image even if they&rsquo;re not touching the original selection.</li>
</ol><hr />
<p></p>
<h2>The Color Range Command</h2>
<p>The Color Range command is similar to the tools in this section in that it makes selections based on colors, but it&rsquo;s much better at selecting areas that contain lots of details. Magic Wand tends to select solid pixels, whereas Color Range tends to select more transparent pixels than solid ones, resulting in softer edges. This fine-tuning lets Color Range produce selections with smoother edges (less blocky and jagged than the ones you get with the Magic Wand) and get in more tightly around areas with lots of details. As a bonus, you also get a handy preview in the Color Range dialog box, showing you which pixels it will select before you commit to the selection (unlike the Grow and Similar commands discussed in the previous section).</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-push-6">
<p>Say you&rsquo;re trying to select the red part of this Texas flag. After clicking once with the Magic Wand (with a Tolerance setting of 32), you still need to select a bit more of the red <em>(left)</em>. Since the red pixels are all touching one another, you can run the Grow command a couple of times to make Photoshop expand your selection to include all the red <em>(right)</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-pull-6"><img src="https://www.msu.edu/user/davisgom/171/assets/images/selections/flag.jpg" alt="Picture of the Texas State flag" class="img-responsive thumbnail" /></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-push-6">
<p>If you want to select the red in these playing cards the Grow command won&rsquo;t help because the red pixels aren&rsquo;t touching one another. In that case, click once with the Magic Wand to select one of the red areas <em>(left)</em> and then use the Similar command to grab the rest of them <em>(right)</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-pull-6"><img src="https://www.msu.edu/user/davisgom/171/assets/images/selections/cards.jpg" alt="Picture of a hand of cards" class="img-responsive thumbnail" /></div>
</div>
<p>Open the Color Range dialog box by choosing Select&rarr;Color Range, either before or after you make a selection. If you haven&rsquo;t yet made a selection, Color Range examines the entire image. If you already have a selection, Photoshop looks only at the pixels within the selected area, which is helpful if you want to isolate a certain area.</p>
<p>For example, you could throw a quick selection around the red flowers in the center of this image and then use Color Range&rsquo;s subtract-from-selection capabilities (explained in a moment) to carve out just the red petals.</p>
<p>By contrast, if you want to use Color Range to help expand your current selection, press and hold the Shift key while you choose Select&rarr;Color Range.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-5">
<p>Use the Select pop-up menu at the top of the Color Range dialog box to tell Photoshop which colors to include in the selection. The menu is automatically set to Sampled Colors, which lets you mouse over to the image (your cursor turns into a tiny eyedropper) and click the color you want to select. If you change the Select menu&rsquo;s setting to Reds, Blues, Greens, or whatever, Color Range will examine your image and grab that range of colors all by itself once you click OK.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-7"><img src="https://www.msu.edu/user/davisgom/171/assets/images/selections/flowers.jpg" alt="Picture of flowers and the Color Range Dialog Box" class="img-responsive thumbnail" /></div>
</div>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to select adjacent pixels, turn on the Localized Color Clusters check-box. When you do, the Range slider becomes active so you can tweak the range of colors Photoshop includes in the selection. Increase this setting and Photoshop includes more colors and makes larger selections; lower it and Photoshop creates a smaller selection because it gets pickier about matching colors.</p>
<p>Use the eyedroppers on the dialog box&rsquo;s right side to add or subtract colors from your selection; the eyedropper with the tiny + sign adds to the selection, and the one with the &ndash; sign subtracts from it. (Use the plain eyedropper to make your initial selection.) When you click one of these eyedroppers, mouse over to your image, and then click the color you want to add or subtract, Photoshop updates the Color Range dialog box&rsquo;s preview to show what the new selection looks like. It sometimes helps to keep the Fuzziness setting fairly low (around 50 or so) while you click repeatedly with the eyedropper.</p>
<p>The Selection Preview pop-up menu at the bottom of the dialog box lets you display a selection preview on the image itself so that, instead of using the dinky preview in the dialog box, you can see the proposed selection right on your image. But you&rsquo;ll probably want to leave this menu set to None, because the preview options that Photoshop offers (Grayscale, Black Matte, and so on) get really distracting.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Selecting Skin Tones and Faces</h2>
<p>New in Photoshop CS6, you can use the Color Range dialog box to help select skin tones. This feature is helpful for making a quick selection of skin tones in order to correct just that part of an image, or to create a layer mask that protects skin tones when you&rsquo;re sharpening, blurring, and so on.</p>
<p>To use it, head to the dialog box&rsquo;s Select menu and choose Skin Tones. Photoshop immediately hunts down all the colors in the image that are similar to those found in a wide variety of human skin (though don&rsquo;t expect it to work well on all ethnicities). You can then use the Fuzziness slider to finetune the selection; drag it left to include less skin or right to include more.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re after faces in particular, turn on the Detect Faces checkbox, and Photoshop looks for faces and includes them in your selection. (The Detect Faces checkbox becomes active when you choose Skin Tones from the Select menu; if you choose Sampled Colors instead, you have to turn on the Localized Color Clusters checkbox before you can turn on Detect Faces.) Selections made with Detect Faces turned on include partially transparent pixels around the faces&rsquo; edges so the changes you make will blend better with surrounding pixels (partially transparent pixels look gray in the preview area).</p>
<p>While this new feature is an interesting idea, it works on only a handful of images. If your image includes a face that&rsquo;s turned in profile or if skin-like colors are found elsewhere in the image&mdash;think light-colored hair, a nude-colored shirt, and so on - you&rsquo;re better off using the Quick Selection tool or a Hue/Saturation adjustment with a targeted color range.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Background and Magic Erasers</h2>
<p>These two tools let you erase parts of an image based on the color under your cursor without having to create a selection first.</p>
<p>Say you have an image with a strong contrast between the item you want to select and its 10 background, like a dead tree against the sky. In that case, Photoshop has a couple of tools that can help you erase the sky super fast. Sure, you could use the Magic Wand or Quick Selection tool to select the sky and then delete or mask it, but the Background Eraser lets you erase more carefully around the edges of the tree.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-push-7">
<p>This tool lets you delete an image&rsquo;s background by painting (dragging) across the pixels you want to delete. When you activate the Background Eraser, your cursor turns into a circle with tiny crosshairs in its center. The crosshairs cursor controls which pixels Photoshop deletes, so be extra careful that it touches only pixels you want to erase. Up in the Options bar, you can tweak the following settings:</p>
<dl><dt>Brush Preset picker</dt><dd>
<p>This is where you choose the shape and size of your brush cursor. For best results, stick with a soft-edged brush. Just click the down- pointing triangle next to this menu to grab one.</p>
</dd></dl></div>
<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-pull-5"><img src="https://www.msu.edu/user/davisgom/171/assets/images/selections/bgeraser.jpg" alt="Exmaple of the Background Eraser tool" /></div>
</div>
<dl><dt>Sampling</dt><dd>
<p>This setting is made up of three buttons whose icons all include eyedroppers. Sampling controls how often Photoshop looks at the color the crosshairs are touching to decide what to erase. If your image&rsquo;s background has a lot of color variation, leave this set to Continuous so Photoshop keeps a constant watch on what color pixels the crosshairs are touching. But if the background&rsquo;s color is fairly uniform, change this setting to Once; Photoshop then checks the color the crosshairs touch just once and resolves to erase only pixels that closely match it. If you&rsquo;re dealing with an image where there&rsquo;s only a small area for you to paint (like a tiny portion of sky showing through a lush tree), change this setting to Background Swatch, which tells Photoshop to erase only colors that are similar to your current background color chip (how similar they have to be is controlled by the Tolerance setting). To choose the color, click the background color chip at the bottom of the Tools panel, mouse over to your image, and then click an area that&rsquo;s the color you want to erase.</p>
</dd><dt>Limits</dt><dd>
<p>When you first launch Photoshop, this field is set to Contiguous, which means the tool erases only pixels adjacent to those you touch with the crosshairs. If you want to erase similar-colored pixels elsewhere in your image (for example, the background behind a really thick tree or a bunch of flowers), change this setting to Discontiguous. Find Edges erases only adjacent pixels, but it does so while preserving the sharpness of the object&rsquo;s edge.</p>
</dd><dt>Tolerance</dt><dd>
<p>This setting works just like the Magic Wand&rsquo;s Tolerance setting: A lower number makes the tool pickier about the pixels it erases, and a higher number makes it less picky.</p>
</dd><dt>Protect Foreground Color</dt><dd>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t seem to get the Tolerance setting high enough and you&rsquo;re still erasing some of the area you want to keep, turning on this checkbox can help. When it&rsquo;s on, you can tell Photoshop which area you want to keep (the foreground) by Option-clicking (Alt-clicking on a PC) that area. If the area you want to keep is a different color in different parts of your image, turn this setting off or Option-click (Alt-click) to resample the foreground area.</p>
</dd></dl><hr />
<p></p>
<h2>Selecting Irregular Areas: <span class="text-muted">The Lasso Tools</span></h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
<p>The regular Lasso tool lets you draw a selection completely freeform as if you were drawing with a pencil. Click in your document and drag to create a selection. Once you stop drawing and release the mouse button, Photoshop automatically completes the selection with a straight line (that is, if you don&rsquo;t complete it yourself by mousing back over your start point) and you see marching ants.</p>
<p>The Options bar sports the same settings whether you have the Lasso tool or the Polygonal Lasso tool active. Here&rsquo;s what it offers:</p>
</div>

</div>
<dl><dt>Mode</dt><dd>
<p>These four buttons let you choose among the same modes you get for most of the selection tools: New, &ldquo;Add to selection,&rdquo; &ldquo;Subtract from selection,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Intersect with selection.&rdquo;</p>
</dd><dt>Feather</dt><dd>
<p>If you want Photoshop to soften the edges of your selection, enter a pixel value in this field. Otherwise, the selection will have a hard edge.</p>
</dd><dt>Anti-alias</dt><dd>
<p>If you leave this setting turned on, Photoshop slightly blurs the edges of your selection, making them less jagged.</p>
</dd><dt>Polygonal Lasso Tool</dt><dd>
<p>If your image has a lot of straight lines in it use the Polygonal Lasso tool. Instead of letting you draw a selection that&rsquo;s any shape at all, the Polygonal Lasso draws only straight lines.</p>
</dd><dt>Magnetic Lasso Tool</dt><dd>
<p>The Magnetic Lasso tool works best when there&rsquo;s strong contrast between the item you want to select and the area around it. However, if you reach an area that doesn&rsquo;t have much contrast&mdash;or a sharp corner&mdash;you can give the tool a little nudge by clicking to set a few anchor points of your own. If it goes astray and sets an erroneous anchor point, tap the Delete key (Backspace on a PC) to get rid of the point and then click to set more anchor points until you reach an area of greater contrast where the tool can be trusted to set its own points.</p>

<h2>Using the Selection Tools Together</h2>
<p>As wonderful as the aforementioned selection tools are individually, they&rsquo;re much more powerful if you use them together.</p>
<p>Remember how every tool discussed so far has an &ldquo;Add to selection&rdquo; and &ldquo;Subtract from selection&rdquo; mode? This means that, no matter which tool you start with, you can add to&mdash;or subtract from&mdash;the active selection with a completely different tool.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Modifying Selections: <span class="text-muted">Refining Edges</span></h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-push-7">
<p>The best selection modifier is the Refine Edge dialog box, which is great for selecting the tough stuff like hair and fur. It combines several edge-adjustment tools that used to be scattered throughout Photoshop&rsquo;s menus and includes an extremely useful preview option.</p>
<p>Anytime you have a selection tool active and some marching ants on 13 your screen, you&rsquo;ll see the Refine Edge button in the Options bar; simply click it to open the dialog box. You can also open it by choosing Select&rarr;Refine Edge, pressing Option-⌘-R (Alt+Ctrl+R on a PC), or by clicking the Properties panel&rsquo;s Mask Edge button.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-pull-5"><img src="https://www.msu.edu/user/davisgom/171/assets/images/selections/modify.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Refine Edge Dialog Box" /></div>
</div>
<p>The Refine Edge dialog box gives you seven different ways to preview your selection. Because the preview appears in the main document window, you&rsquo;ll want to move the Refine Edge dialog box aside so it&rsquo;s not covering your image. Depending on the colors in your image, one of these View modes will let you see the selection better than the rest:</p>
<dl><dt>Marching Ants</dt><dd>
<p>This view just shows the selection on the image itself.<br /> Keyboard shortcut: <strong>M</strong></p>
</dd><dt>Overlay</dt><dd>
<p>As the name indicates, this view displays your selection overlaid with the Quick Mask, which unless you&rsquo;ve changed its color, is light red. Because the red overlay is seethrough, it&rsquo;s the best choice when your selection will include hair or fur that isn&rsquo;t included in the selection just yet. Keyboard shortcut: <strong>V</strong></p>
</dd><dt>On Black</dt><dd>
<p>This view displays the selection on a black background, which is helpful if your image is light colored and doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of black in it.<br /> Keyboard shortcut: <strong>B</strong></p>
</dd><dt>On White</dt><dd>
<p>Choose this view if your image is mostly dark. The stark white back- ground makes it easy to see your selection and the object you&rsquo;re selecting while you&rsquo;re fine-tuning it using the dialog box&rsquo;s settings.<br /> Keyboard shortcut: <strong>W</strong></p>
</dd><dt>Black &amp; White</dt><dd>
<p>This view displays your selection as an alpha channel. Photoshop makes your selection white and the mask black; transitions between the two areas are subtle shades of gray. The gray areas let you see how detailed your mask is, so you&rsquo;ll spend a fair amount of time in this mode.<br /> Keyboard shortcut: <strong>K</strong></p>
</dd><dt>On Layers</dt><dd>
<p>To see your selection atop the gray-and-white transparency checker-board, choose this mode.<br /> Keyboard shortcut: <strong>L</strong></p>
</dd><dt>Reveal Layer</dt><dd>
<p>This mode displays your image without a selection.<br /> Keyboard shortcut: <strong>R</strong></p>
</dd></dl>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve chosen a View mode, you can tweak the following settings (and for best results, Adobe suggests you adjust them in this order):</p>
<dl><dt>Smart Radius</dt><dd>
<p>Turn this checkbox on to make Photoshop look closely at the edges of your selection to determine whether they&rsquo;re hard (like the outline of your subject&rsquo;s body) or soft (like your subject&rsquo;s hair or fur).</p>
</dd><dt>Radius</dt><dd>
<p>This setting controls the size of the area affected by the settings in this dialog box&mdash;in other words, how far beyond the edge of your selection Photoshop looks when it&rsquo;s refining that edge.</p>
</dd><dt>Refine Radius tool</dt><dd>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve turned on Smart Radius, you can use this tool paint over the edges of your selection to make Photoshop fine-tune them even more in particular spots.</p>
</dd><dt>Erase Refinements tool</dt><dd>
<p>If Photoshop gets a little overzealous and includes too much of the background in your selection as you drag with the Refine Radius tool, use this tool to drag across the areas you don&rsquo;t want to include in the selection.</p>
</dd><dt>Smooth</dt><dd>
<p>Increasing this setting makes Photoshop smooth the selection&rsquo;s edges so they&rsquo;re less jagged, but increasing it too much can make you lose details (especially on selections of things like hair).</p>
</dd><dt>Feather</dt><dd>
<p>This setting controls how much Photoshop softens the edges of your selection, which is useful when you&rsquo;re combining images.</p>
</dd><dt>Contrast</dt><dd>
<p>This setting sharpens your selection&rsquo;s edge, even if you softened it by increasing the Radius setting mentioned above. A higher number here creates a sharper edge and can actually reduce the noisy or grainy look that&rsquo;s sometimes caused by a high Radius setting.</p>
</dd><dt>Shift Edge</dt><dd>
<p>You can tighten your selection (make it smaller) by dragging this slider to the left, which is a good idea if you&rsquo;re dealing with hair or fur. To expand your selection and grab pixels you missed when you made the initial selection, drag this slider to the right.</p>
</dd><dt>Decontaminate Colors</dt><dd>
<p>This option helps reduce edge halos: leftover colored pixels around the edges of a selection that you see only after you put the object on a new background. Once you turn this checkbox on, Photoshop tries to replace the color of selected pixels with the color of pixels nearby.</p>
</dd><dt>Output To</dt><dd>
<p>This setting lets you tell Photoshop what you&rsquo;d like it to do with your new and improved selection. Here are your options:</p>
<dl class="well"><dt>Selection</dt><dd>
<p>Adjusts your original selection, leaving you with marching ants on your original layer just like you started with.</p>
</dd><dt>Layer Mask</dt><dd>
<p>Adds a layer mask to the current layer according to the selection you just made. You&rsquo;ll choose this option most of the time.</p>
</dd><dt>New Layer</dt><dd>
<p>Deletes the background and creates a new layer containing only the selected item, with no marching ants.</p>
</dd><dt>New Layer with Layer Mask</dt><dt></dt></dl>
<p>Adds a new layer complete with layer mask.</p>
<dl class="well"><dt></dt><dt>New Document</dt><dd>
<p>Deletes the background and sends only the selected item to a brandnew document.</p>
</dd><dt>New Document with Layer Mask</dt><dd>
<p>Sends the selected item to a new document complete with editable layer mask.</p>
</dd></dl></dd></dl><hr />
<p></p>
<h2>Creating a Border Selection</h2>
<p>If you look at the Select&rarr;Modify submenu, you&rsquo;ll find the same options as in the Refine Edge dialog box (but without a preview). There is, however, one addition: Border, which lets you turn a solid selection into a hollow one. Let&rsquo;s say you drew a circular selection with the Elliptical Marquee tool. You can turn that selection into a ring (handy if you want to make a neon sign or select the outer rim of an object) by choosing Select&rarr;Modify&rarr;Border. Just enter a pixel width, click OK.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<h2>Transforming a Selection</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve made a selection, choose Select&rarr;Transform Selection or Control-&shy;‐click (right-&shy;‐click on a PC) inside the selection and, from the shortcut menu that appears, choose Transform Selection. Photoshop puts a rectangular box with little, square resizing handles on its four sides around your selection (this is called a bounding box). You can move the selection around by clicking inside the bounding box and dragging in any direction. (If you want to get rid of the bounding box without making any changes, press the Esc key.)</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<h2>Using Quick Mask Mode</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;d rather fine-tune selections by painting with a brush, no problem; in fact, you can create a selection from scratch using this method. Just enter Quick Mask mode and you&rsquo;ll find all of Photoshop&rsquo;s painting tools and filters waiting to help you tweak your selection. This mode gives you the freedom to work on selections with almost any tool.</p>
<p>You can enter Quick Mask mode by pressing the Q key or clicking the circle-within-a-square button at the bottom of the Tools panel (not the Layers panel). When you do, Photoshop looks to see whether you have an active selection. If you do, it puts a red overlay over everything but the selection. (If you don&rsquo;t have an active selection, you won&rsquo;t see any change, but you can still use the directions in this section to create a selection.) This color-coding makes it easy to edit your selection visually by painting.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re in Quick Mask mode, you can use the Brush tool to do any of the following:</p>
<dl><dt>Deselect a portion of your selection</dt><dd>
<p>In other words, to add an area to the mask - by setting your foreground color chip to black and then painting across the unwanted area.</p>
</dd><dt>Extend the area covered by your selection</dt><dd>
<p>By painting the spot you want to add with white (you may need to press x to flip-flop your color chips).</p>
</dd><dt>Create a soft-edged selection or semi-transparent area</dt><dd>
<p>By painting with gray. For example, by painting with 50 percent gray (to do that, lower a black brush&rsquo;s opacity in the Options bar 16 to 50 percent), you&rsquo;ll create a selection that&rsquo;s partially see-through. You can create a similar effect by painting with a soft-edged brush.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p>All the usual tools and document tricks work while you&rsquo;re in Quick Mask mode: You can zoom in or out by pressing ⌘ and the + or &ndash; key (Ctrl and + or &ndash; on a PC), press and hold the space bar to move around within the document once you&rsquo;re zoomed in, and use any of the selection tools covered in this chapter. You can also fill the entire mask, or your selection, with black or white, which is helpful when you have a large area to paint or when you want to paint the entire selection by hand. You can run filters in this mode to create interesting edges or use the Gradient tool, set to a black-to-white gradient, to create a fade.</p>
<p>Once you finish fine-tuning your selection, press the <strong>Q</strong> key to exit Quick Mask mode and the marching ants come rushing back so you can see the newly edited selection.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Moving Selections</h2>
<p>If you create a selection that&rsquo;s not in exactly the right spot or you&rsquo;ve got several objects of the same shape that you want to alter, you may need to move the selection itself. Or maybe you need to move the pixels underneath the selection, or move them onto their own layer. In any of those cases, you&rsquo;ve got plenty of options:</p>
<dl><dt>Moving the selection (the marching ants) within the same layer.</dt><dd>
<p>Make sure you have a selection tool active (it doesn&rsquo;t matter which one), and then click inside the selection and drag it to another part of the document. You can also nudge the selection into place with the arrow keys on your keyboard.</p>
</dd><dt>Moving the selected object onto its own new layer within the same document.</dt><dd>
<p>Press ⌘-J (Ctrl+J on a PC) to &ldquo;jump&rdquo; the selected pixels onto their very own layer, just above the current layer. That way, whatever you do to the selected area won&rsquo;t harm the original image. If you don&rsquo;t like your changes, you can throw the extra layer away. Or, if you create an effect that&rsquo;s a little too strong&mdash;maybe you overwhitened a set of teeth&mdash;you can reduce the layer&rsquo;s opacity to lessen the effect.</p>
</dd><dt>Moving the selected object to another document.</dt><dd>
<p>Press ⌘-C (Ctrl+C) to copy the selected pixels and then open the other document and press ⌘-V (Ctrl+V) to paste the pixels. The pasted object appears on its very own layer that you can reposition with the Move tool.</p>
</dd><dt>Moving the selected object to a new document.</dt><dd>
<p>Copy the object as described above and then choose File&rarr;New. Photoshop opens a new document, sized to match the object you copied; press <strong>⌘-V</strong> (Ctrl+V) to paste the object.</p>
</dd></dl><hr />
<p></p>
<h2>Saving a Selection</h2>
<p>After you create the selection, choose Select&rarr;Save Selection. In the resulting dialog box give your selection a meaningful name and then press OK. When you&rsquo;re finished working with that document, be sure to save it as a PSD file.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-7">
<p>When you&rsquo;re ready to use the selection again, pop open the document in which it was saved and choose Select&rarr;Load Selection. In the resulting dialog box, click the Channel pop-up menu and pick your selection from the list (if you&rsquo;ve saved only one selection in this particular document, Photoshop chooses it automatically). Leave the Operation section of the dialog box set to New Selection to bring back the saved selection as a whole (instead of adding to or subtracting from another selection). Press OK and the marching ants reappear, just like you saved them.</p>
<p>Although the radio buttons in the Operation section of the Load Selection dialog box let you add to, subtract from, or intersect other selections with the saved selection, it&rsquo;s easier just to load the selection, close the dialog box, and then edit it using the selection tools.</p>
</div>

<p></p>
<h2>Filling a Selection with Color</h2>
<p>Filling selections with color is a great way to create shapes and add colorful photo borders to images. After you&rsquo;ve created the selection, you can fill it with color in a couple of ways. One option is to choose Edit&rarr;Fill and, from the Use pop-up menu, choose Color. Pick something from the resulting Color Picker, and then click OK twice to dismiss the dialog boxes. Photoshop fills your selection with the color you picked.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a more flexible way to fill a selection with color is to add a Solid Color Adjustment layer. Once you&rsquo;ve made a selection, click the half-black/half-white circle at the bottom of the Layers panel and then choose Solid Color (or choose Layer&rarr;New Fill Layer&rarr;Solid Color instead). Then grab a color from the resulting Color Picker and click OK. Photoshop dutifully fills the selected area with color, and you see a new Solid Color Fill layer appear in the Layers panel. To change the color of this layer, simply double-click its thumbnail to reopen the Color Picker.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<h2>Stroking (Outlining) a Selection</h2>
<p>While you can stroke selections of any shape, this technique comes in handy when you use it in conjunction with the Photoshop&rsquo;s vector tools.</p>
<p>In CS6, you can stroke any vector shape you create&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s with the Pen tool or one of the shape tools&mdash;with a variety of line widths and colors, including dashes or dots. That said, if you want to add a stroke to a layer, you can do it with layer styles.</p>
<p>If the image lives on its own layer, click the tiny fx button at the bottom of the Layers panel and choose Stroke. In the resulting Layer Style dialog box, enter a size for the stroke and then choose a Location from the pop-up menu (if the image is the same size as your Photoshop document, be sure to choose Inside so the stroke appears inside the margins instead of outside them).</p>
<p>Last but not least, click the colored square to pop open the Color Picker and choose a color for the stroke. Click OK to close the Layer Style dialog box and call it done. To edit the stroke&rsquo;s size or color later on, just double-click the Stroke layer style in the Layers panel and the Layer Style dialog box pops open. If the object you want to stroke isn&rsquo;t isolated on its own layer&mdash;say, you want to circle yourself in a photo&mdash;use CS6&rsquo;s Ellipse tool instead and then add the stroke using the Options bar&rsquo;s new settings.</p>
