<title>Scanning Exercise</title>

</head>
<body>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>After successful completion of this assignment, the student will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate correct scanning resolutions for different image applications.</li>
<li>Execute a series of image scans that demonstrate an appropriate tonal range.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>
<p>Using your own photographic images (prints, magazines, etc.) complete the following image scans using a flatbed scanner. Save your image scans with appropriate names, following the file naming convention:</p>
<pre><code>
  yourname-scan-color.psd

  yourname-scan-gray.psd

  yourname-scan-color-web.psd
</code>
</pre>
<p class="alert alert-success">Once scanned and named, upload your images to the <a href="<!-- @scanning-dropbox -->" target="_self" class="alert-link">Scanning Assignment Dropbox</a>.</p>

<h4>1. Scanning from a Color Print</h4>
<p><strong>For use in a high-quality 4-color printed publication.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Final image size: 5&rdquo; wide by 3.5&rdquo; high</li>
<li>Final image resolution: 133 lpi print reproduction (double your pixels, <strong style="color: red;">scan at 266 dpi</strong>) <br /> <em>(Normally you would change this to CMYK, but leave as RGB for this exercise)</em></li>
</ul>

<hr class="line" />
<h4>2. Scanning from a Black and White Print</h4>
<p><strong>For use in a Greyscale newspaper publication.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Final image size: 6&rdquo; wide by 4.5&rdquo; high</li>
<li>Final image resolution: 85 lpi print halftone reproduction (double your pixels, <strong style="color: red;">scan at 170 dpi</strong>)<br /> <em>(If you scan in RGB, be sure to convert to Grayscale before saving)</em></li>
</ul>

<hr class="line" />
<h4>3. Scanning from a Color Print</h4>
<p><strong>For use in a web design.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Final image size: 4.5&rdquo; wide by 3&rdquo; high</li>
<li>Final image resolution: 72 dpi (screen resolution <strong style="color: red;">scan at 72 dpi</strong>)</li>
</ul>
