<title>Product Cross-Section Project</title>

</head>
<body>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>The final image will be a composite that illustrates a product/object with part of the cover(s) being transparent to show the inner workings. To do this project, you will need to shoot multiple images of the same object with your camera mounted in the same exact place so that the images will line up as separate layers in Photoshop. Use a tripod or duct tape to hold the camera in place. From there, you can use a layer mask to hide elements from one layer to reveal another layer below. Appropriate lighting is also a critical factor in that it must align for both the cover-on and cover-off images used.</p>
<p>Remember that as an advanced professional digital artist, you want to respect both the original image and the pixels used in the digital file. Your intention is not necessarily to create a simple fade from one layer to another, but rather to create an artistic statement. To that end, be aware of things like composition, focal point, color, texture, technique, etc. In addition, use the digital tools that Photoshop offers to set yourself up for optimal control and flexibility.</p>

<h3>Project Specifications</h3>
<p>To satisfy the project requirements you will need to submit one finished high-resolution Photoshop image. You will need to submit an original un-retouched version of your image, with your final image so that I can see where you started. You can include the original image as a layer in the final image file.</p>
<p>Save your image with appropriate names,<br />following the file naming convention:</p>
<pre><code>
  yourname-cross-section.psd
