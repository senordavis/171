<title>Photo Restoration Project</title>

</head>
<body>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Digital imaging has changed the way that old or damaged prints are retouched and restored. Developing the skills to restore old or damaged images could be your ticket to a job in digital imaging. Each student will complete the entire production process of retouching and image to produce a final restored image.</p>
<p>Remember that as a digital artist, you want to respect both the original image and the pixels used in the digital file. Your intention is not necessarily to create a super-clean image that could have been taken today, but rather to reveal the quality and character of the image.</p>
<p>Make sure that you go beyond simply cleaning up dust spots. Use the digital tools that Photoshop offers to set yourself up for optimal control and flexibility while restoring the photo.</p>
