<title>Painting Project</title>

<body>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Given the name, Photoshop has traditionally focused on manipulating and refining photos. The tools exist, however, to also take those photos from realistic imagery to more &ldquo;painterly&rdquo; presentations.</p>
<p>As a professional digital artist, you want to respect both the original images and the pixels used in the digital file. Your intention is not necessarily to create a simple assemblage of elements, but rather to create an artistic statement. To that end, be aware of things like composition, focal point, color, texture, technique, etc. Give your design some sort of theme or intention. Begin this project by finding a historical painting whose style and content appeals to you, and use that image as a guide.</p>

<h3>Project Specifications</h3>
<p>To satisfy the project requirements you will need to submit one finished high-resolution Photoshop image at least 1500 pixels by 2000 pixels. You will also need to submit your original un-retouched images along with your final image so that I can see where you started. You can include the original images as separate layers in the final image file.</p>
<p>Save your image with appropriate names,<br />following the file naming convention:</p>
<pre><code>
  yourname-painting.psd
</code>
</pre>

<p class="alert alert-success">Once completed, upload your images to the <a href="<!-- @painting-dropbox -->" target="_top" class="alert-link">Painting Dropbox</a>.</p>
