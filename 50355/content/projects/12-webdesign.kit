<title>Web Design Project</title>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>The homepage for LCC needs a facelift, and you have been chosen to do the layout.</p>
<p>The interface should consider what the primary thing you want someone to do once they have visited your site. So what is the call to action? How should a user feel when they visit your site, and what should be their lasting experience? Decide how the color scheme, typography and layout help to reinforce the message. A good place to start is by looking at the other websites, either of other colleges/universities, or just other sites in general.</p>
